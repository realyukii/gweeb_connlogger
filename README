This repository is part of GNU/Weeb challanges:
- part 1, simple program loaded and executed through LD_PRELOAD: https://t.me/GNUWeeb/1166930
- part 2, an extension of part 1, adding functionality to log HTTP-based connection: https://t.me/GNUWeeb/1167135

- linux shared library
- inline assembly in C

topic I learned on part 2:
- managing context in C
- parsing streamed data in C

- edge cases when handling HTTP connection

edge cases:
- log the URI string up to 300k according to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/417142/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-url-in-different-browsers

Compiled and tested on: Linux x86_64 glibc.
