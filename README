This repository is part of GNU/Weeb challanges:
- part 1, simple program loaded and executed through LD_PRELOAD: https://t.me/GNUWeeb/1166930
- part 2, an extension of part 1, adding functionality to log HTTP-based connection: https://t.me/GNUWeeb/1167135

topic I learned on part 1:
- linux shared library
- inline assembly in C

topic I learned on part 2:
- managing context in C
- parsing streamed data in C
- queue data structure
- edge cases when handling HTTP connection

edge cases:
- a server that respond multiple request of HTTP pipeline in just one recv
- a server that ignore part of HTTP request pipeline by closing it in the middle

Compiled and tested on: Linux x86_64 glibc.
